## I build software

  Hi, I'm **Ricardo**, a software engineer working in London in the
startup scene.

  I firmly believe in minimalism, sophistication and composable
abstractions. Every environment should be automated and easily
reproducible. Declarative systems are far superior and side effects
should be always under control.

Because writing good software implies:

- Following the KISS principle
- Following the UNIX philosophy
- Small, simple and modular is better than big, complex and monolithic
- Using a decent OS and a good programming language
- Modeling the problem adequately

  Because if someone is creating accidental complexity instead solving
the actual problem, because if someone is creating a huge monolithic
pile of rubbish instead of a modular and composable solution, because if
someone is not creating a software easy to configure and test, because
if someone is not paying enough attention to the low level details, then
this person is doing it wrong.
