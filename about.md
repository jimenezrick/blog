  Hi, I'm Ricardo, a software engineer working in London in the startup
scene.

  I firmly believe in minimalism but also I'm in favor of sophistication
and automation.

Because writing good software implies:

- Following the KISS principle
- Following the UNIX philosophy
- Small, simple and modular is better than big, complex and monolithic
- Using a decent OS and a good programming language

  Because if someone is creating accidental complexity instead solving
the actual problem, because if someone is creating a huge monolithic
pile of rubbish instead of a modular and abstract solution, because if
someone is not creating a software easy to test, because if someone is
not paying enough attention to the low level details, then this person
is doing it wrong.
