  The Web as we know is a f!cking shameful mess of technologies but one
of the few things I like about it is how highly decoupled is the fronted
from the backend. This implies that us, the developers, are able to use
whatever programming language we want. And of course, it is one of the
greatest joys to use your favourite programming language for some
practical purpose.

That's why this blog is written in Haskell.
