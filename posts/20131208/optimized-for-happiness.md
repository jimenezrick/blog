  It is so frequently common these days to publish in the web some
argumentation or rant in favor or against any programming language
giving apparently deep technical reasons but the reality seems quite the
opposite to me, that these seem more like personal preferences instead
of real engineering advantages.

  So, the next time you choose the language your are going to use don't
forget that you are not only pragmatic but emotional as well, even more
than you think. Thus don't try so hard to hide it. Just accept it.

  From any number of programming languages that fit the bill, choose the
one that you are going to be the happiest working with.

  And yes, this blog is written in Haskell and I did very much enjoy by
doing so.
