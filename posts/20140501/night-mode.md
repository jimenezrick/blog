% Night mode for Xorg

  I just wanted to share a simple script I use when I'm working late in
my computer. Apparently there is evidence that [blue light affects
sleep](https://justgetflux.com/research.html) and I've been testing it
for some time and I can say that I feel the difference. After reducing
my exposure to blue light before going to bed I feel more tired and more
predisposed to sleep.

  I don't like installing additional applications for this kind of
purpose, thus I'm using this embarrassedly simple script to reduce the
blue component and the brightness of all my Xorg displays:

	#!/bin/sh

	adjust_output() {
		for out in $(xrandr | sed -n 's/^\([^ ]*\).*\<connected\>.*/\1/p'); do
			xrandr --output $out --gamma $1 --brightness $2
		done
	}

	case $1 in
		off) adjust_output 1:1:1   1.0 ;;
		*)   adjust_output 1:1:0.5 0.7 ;;
	esac
